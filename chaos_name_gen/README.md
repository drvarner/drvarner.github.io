This is meant to be used as a companion to the [Warhammer: Age of Sigmar](http://www.blacklibrary.com/all-products/aos-path-to-glory.html) and [Warhammer 40k](http://www.blacklibrary.com/warhammer-40000/40k-path-to-glory.html) Path to Glory campaigns by [Games Workshop](http://www.games-workshop.com).

I whipped this up in a few minutes while I was bored at work so don't go expecting amazing things. It does exactly what it says on the tin and should run in most (but probably all) modern browsers.

Just clone or download the zip and open 'index.html' in your browser and click away!
